# Systemd
[Here](/systemd/att-fiber-gateway-info.service) is a tested systemd service file
for running this as a daemon on a Linux system as root.

You should make sure there is a configuration file,
`/root/.att-fiber-gateway-info.yml`. Also that it is properly configured before
starting the service.
